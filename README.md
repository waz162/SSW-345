Reflection

Over the past two milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a bot project.

Design
1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

	The most helpful aspect of thinking about design methods for my FocusBot was figuring out what our TechStack would look like for the bot. This was helpful because if we didn’t chose the platform for the bot, then we wouldn’t know how the backend will operate. Choosing our TechStack early helped us lay the early framework for the Bot and help get a start from there.

1. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

	The most difficult part was first deciding which bot project to do. Then after, since we decided the FocusBot, we had to decide what it meant in it’s functionality because just FocusBot is very broad and can mean many things. If I had to do it again, I would be more decisive in the bot choosing and also in its functionalities.

1. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
	
	The design methods I would try again would be implementing Data-Structure oriented design into the team project. It helps the team work faster and gives the users individual goals. Especially with Bot because a lot of them use different sets of data and it would be helpful in that case.
Implementation
1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

	The most helpful aspect about implementing, testing, and integrating our bot project was to get comfortable with the backend. We used mongoose for the API of the bot and the most helpful part was getting used to the TechStack. The testing portion was helpful in seeing if the bot communicated with the user and seeing which functions were not working correctly. The most  important part of integrating was connecting all the different things we used together to make the bot finally function and “talk” to the user.

1. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

	The most difficult part was figuring out the API as well as mongoose. I’ve personally never used it before but Dewey helped us both in doing it. I would have been more decisive with the API which would expedite the other steps.

1. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

	Other implementation, testing, and integration methods I would want to try in the future is the Bottom-Up approach. In this way, if the smaller parts of the program don’t work, it’s easier to test it and conduct corrective measures. This would be useful on bot projects because most of the bot projects are based on a lot of smaller functions.  https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/what-is-integration-testing/


Process
1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

	KanBan and code review were very helpful in our project because it helped us organize our ideas and user stories and all of us see our progress in the project. It helped us see which developers could do what since we were all at different skill levels.

1. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

	The most difficult part was taking into account our unfamiliarity with it. For some user stories they would take much longer than others but the Kanban board doesn’t show it that way. The best way to solve this is to do pair programming when you get stuck on certain user stories or seek outside help.

1. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

	I liked the Kanban board and I think with more practice with it, it could become a very effective tool in team based projects once you get more practice with it.


Overall
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
